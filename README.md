<b>Introduction:</b><p>
CNNPlay allows you to explore and play with convolutional neural networks with the aim to classify
images into groups. CNNs have been the backbone of deep learning in medical imaging for the past few
years, and this application allows users without coding knowledge to build their own deep learning models.
